##Events checklist
The following is a checklist or process for events attended by Blockstack members.

###Pre-event
* Who is on the panel?
  * In order to determine whether or not we should accept an event we need to ensure that the quality of the panel is worthy.
    * Will the panel quality invoke a good discussion?
* Will there be video or livestreaming at the event
* Tweet about the event

###During event
* Wear Blockstack t-shirt at the event
* How many people are in attendance?
* Show of hands. How many people have heard about Blockstack?
* How many of you have tried out the Blockstack CLI? (Will change to "...have downloaded the browser?")
* Introduction to Blockstack

###Post event
* Tweet about the event
* Take 5 minutes to jot down key points or lessons learned from the event
* Acquire content in the form of video, social media, audio, etc.
